# VexAutonTemplate

These are 3 gui templates in different coding languages.

The block gui template is unfortunatly going to be a switch block with python due to it being a python based template.

Use these as you want just please write your own versions not copying my examples. Also I cannot guarentee that they work on a real vex brain until 7/28/25 at the earliest. If you find the examples to not work or have any other issues please open a github issue or message @1060Z on vexforum.com.
